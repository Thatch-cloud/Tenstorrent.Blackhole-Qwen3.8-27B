# >>> qual_card.sh: which board a qualification harness runs on (canonical copy scripts/ci/qual_card.sh)
# Every single-card harness under optimisation/ttnn-op embeds this block byte for byte (the scripts in
# scripts/ci source the file); scripts/ci/test_qual_card.py fails when a copy drifts, and
# `py -3.11 -B scripts/ci/test_qual_card.py --sync` re-copies the canonical text into every harness.
#
# The rig has three p150a. Card M (blackhole-CEF5729692C19E6D) and card A (blackhole-3707293C249A5E67)
# are the serving pair: Ethernet-linked, mounted by every CI gate arm (lever_n_m3native_run_arm.sh), and
# reset together by the gate. Card B (blackhole-F36F768B9A5CAFA0, PCIe only) is the qualification card.
# /dev/tenstorrent/N numbers change across resets and switch power-cycles, and tt-smi's own board index
# is a different numbering again, so nothing here hard-codes either: the target is a board id, its node
# is resolved with readlink -f at launch and again right before the container starts, and the reset
# hint prints commands that resolve the board id when they are run (never a bare index) plus the PCI
# address that identifies the board's row in tt-smi -ls.
#
# Only the m3native gate (qwen-lever-n-m3native-gate.yml) is scoped to the serving pair. qwen-card-reset.yml
# and most other qwen-* hardware workflows still act on every node, or on fixed node numbers, in the same
# qwen-two-p150a-exclusive group: check gh run list for that group before and during a card-B session.

#   ALLOW_SERVING_CARD=1    required to target card M or card A (half of the serving pair); loud warning
#
#   qual_card_select      sets QUAL_CARD, QUAL_BYID, QUAL_TAG, QUAL_SERVING; refuses a serving card
#                         without the override. Touches no device: dry runs call it too.
#   qual_card_resolve     sets QUAL_NODE (readlink -f, now) and QUAL_PCI; refuses a missing board and
#                         treats a board id that resolves to a serving card's node as that serving card.
#   qual_refuse_holders   refuses while a container or a host process can reach the target.
#   qual_card_recheck     readlink -f again right before the container starts; refuses if the node moved.

# Why a container (qual_refuse_holders' docker inspect lines) can reach the target; nothing when it cannot.
# A non-privileged container reaches a device only through its device list, its device cgroup rules and
# its device requests: a bind mount of /dev or /dev/tenstorrent shows node files it cannot open (every CI
# gate arm mounts /dev/tenstorrent read-only for its board-mapping check and is given card M and card A
# only). So for a non-serving target it names: --privileged; any device cgroup rule; a device request
# naming Tenstorrent (CDI); a mapped device path that is the target's node, has the target's device
# numbers, is a directory holding the node, or is a /dev/tenstorrent path that is not a device node now
# (which board it was given is unknowable); a mount of the target's node itself. For a serving target
# (ALLOW_SERVING_CARD=1) it names any container that can reach any Tenstorrent device: --privileged, a
# device cgroup rule, a Tenstorrent device request, or /dev or a tenstorrent path among its devices or

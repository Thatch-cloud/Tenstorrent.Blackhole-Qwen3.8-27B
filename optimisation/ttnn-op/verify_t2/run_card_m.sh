# >>> qual_card.sh: which board a qualification harness runs on (canonical copy scripts/ci/qual_card.sh)
# Every single-card harness under optimisation/ttnn-op embeds this block byte for byte (the scripts in
# scripts/ci source the file); scripts/ci/test_qual_card.py fails when a copy drifts, and
# `py -3.11 -B scripts/ci/test_qual_card.py --sync` re-copies the canonical text into every harness.
#
# The rig has three p150a. Card M (blackhole-CEF5729692C19E6D) and card A (blackhole-3707293C249A5E67)
# are the serving pair: Ethernet-linked, mounted by every CI gate arm (lever_n_m3native_run_arm.sh), and
# reset together by the gate. Card B (blackhole-F36F768B9A5CAFA0) is reserved for another project: no
# harness may select it, so there is no default target, and nothing here opens, maps, resets or waits
# on it. /dev/tenstorrent/N numbers change across resets and switch power-cycles, and tt-smi's own board
# index is a different numbering again, so nothing here hard-codes either: the target is a board id, its
# node is resolved with readlink -f at launch and again right before the container starts, and the
# reset hint prints commands that resolve the board id when they are run (never a bare index) plus the
# PCI address that identifies the board's row in tt-smi -ls.
#
# The qwen-* hardware workflows in the qwen-two-p150a-exclusive group act on card M and card A: a run on
# either must not overlap them - check gh run list for that group before and during it.

#                         call it too.
#   qual_card_resolve     sets QUAL_NODE (readlink -f, now) and QUAL_PCI; refuses a missing board and a

#                         serving card's node as that serving card.
